User sign up with facebook or google and login with facebook or google do the same - creates user record in mongodb if it hadn't be done yet and logins to the account. Once user registered his email with facebook or google, he cannot login with email form. Although, user can login to the account created by submitting email form with facebook or google. After login, client retrieves jwt token and stores in the browser. It expires after 7 days, so it would be good to refresh after user enter his account.
